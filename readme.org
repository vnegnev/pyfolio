* Introduction

  A basic portfolio calculator in Python.
  Written for simple stock and stock option trading.
  Allows you to see the impact that changing underlying prices and IVs will have on your positions.

  Currently just uses the basic Black-Scholes European-style option pricing model.
  WARNING: the days-until-expiry calculation does NOT skip weekends and public holidays yet, so watch out if you're using this for options near expiry!

* Requirements

  Python 3.x, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib

* Quickstart

  - Clone the repo

  - Read examples.py for examples of how to use it

  - Write and run your own Python file containing your positions
